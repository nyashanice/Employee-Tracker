# Employee-Tracker

## Description

The Employee Tracker provides a way for employers to keep track of who is employed at a facility, what role they're in, who their manager is, and the salary for each role. This is a very useful and easy tool that could make finding this important information much quicker. This would allow employers to spend their time doing other things instead of spending too much time searching for employee information.

While building the Employee Tracker, I learned how to use MySQL and create databases.

## Installation

The application requires node, express, and mysql2.

## Usage

In the terminal, after creating the database and running `node index.js`, you will see a list of options. Use your keyboard to navigate through the menu and fill in the information that is asked of you.
